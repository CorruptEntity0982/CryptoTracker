# CryptoTracker

### Application Overview
A price alert application that triggers an email when the userâ€™s target price is
Achieved.
Say, the current price of BTC is 28,000, a user sets an alert for BTC at a price of 33,000.
The application sends an email to the user when the price of BTC reaches 33,000.
Similarly, say, the current price of BTC is 35,000, a user sets an alert for BTC at a price of
33,000. The application should send an email when the price of BTC reaches 33,000.

I've used fastapi(python library for creating these endpoints) along with email STMP services.
Also ive used "https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/markets?vs_currency=USD&order=ma" to get the prices of cryptocurrencies.
